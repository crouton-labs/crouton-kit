# Grove Plant

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

Create an isolated parallel instance of a project with automatic port allocation. Seeded projects (those with `.claude/grove/config.json`) skip discovery and let the CLI handle all post-plant configuration via `setup.sh`. Unseeded projects go through full discovery.

## Step 1: Parse arguments and check registration

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:
- `source-path` — absolute or relative path to the source project
- `instance-name` — name for the new instance
- `--slot N` — optional explicit slot (1-9, auto-assigned if omitted)

Check if the project is already registered:

```bash
grove list
```

---

## Step 2: Check for grove config

```bash
test -f <source-path>/.claude/grove/config.json && echo "SEEDED" || echo "NOT_SEEDED"
```

**If SEEDED** → continue to Step 3 (fast path).
**If NOT_SEEDED** → skip to Step 7 (legacy path).

---

## Step 3: Register if needed (seeded projects)

If the project was not in `grove list` output:

```bash
grove register <source-path> --from-config
```

---

## Step 4: Plant

```bash
grove plant <project> <instance-name> [--slot N]
```

Parse the `--- grove-output ---` JSON block from stdout. It contains:
- `target` — new instance directory path
- `slot` — assigned slot number
- `ports` — computed port mappings per service
- `source` — source project path

The CLI handles all config-driven setup automatically:
- Clones repos or rsync copies source
- Copies files from source (`copyFromSource`)
- Patches port references in matching files (`patchPortsIn`)
- Installs dependencies (`install`)
- Runs `setup.sh` last (if present) for custom logic

Check the output for any setup warnings or errors.

---

## Step 5: Verify

- Target directory exists
- No stale base port references remain in `.claude/` files:
  ```bash
  grep -rl ':<base_port>' <target>/.claude/ 2>/dev/null
  # Should return empty for each base port
  ```
- `.env` port values match slot-computed values from the grove-output JSON

---

## Step 6: Report

Output a summary with:
- Instance path, slot number, project name
- Port assignments per service
- What setup.sh configured automatically
- Any warnings from setup.sh output

---

## Discovery Path (unseeded projects)

> **Tip:** Run `/grove:seed <source-path>` first to make this project portable for your team. It generates `.claude/grove/config.json` and `setup.sh` so future plants skip discovery entirely.

---

## Step 7: Codebase Discovery (unseeded projects only)

Launch **three parallel explore agents** to analyze the source project. Each agent reports findings concisely.

### Agent 1: Port & Service Map

The port map drives everything — slot assignment, .env patching, and verification. Incomplete discovery means services silently connect to the wrong instance. Explore the codebase to build a complete port map:

- Find all `.env`, `.env.*`, `.env.example`, `.env.local` files
- Extract every `PORT=`, `*_PORT=`, `*_URL=` variable
- Identify the project structure — monorepo with subdirectories, or single service?
- Map inter-service communication — which services reference other services' URLs/ports?
- Find database connection strings and their ports
- Check Docker Compose files for port mappings

**Output:** A table of services, their base ports, what env var controls each, and what offset to use (default 100, use 1 for things like CDP debug ports).

### Agent 2: Hardcoded Port Scan

Env-var-driven ports get patched automatically during setup. Hardcoded ports don't — they silently point the new instance at the original's services, or cause bind conflicts on startup. Search the entire source (excluding node_modules, .next, dist) for hardcoded port references. These are the places people miss:

**Non-obvious locations to check:**
- `.claude/commands/*.md` — slash commands with hardcoded ports in examples or verification steps. Claude sessions in the new instance will run these commands against the wrong services.
- `.claude/scripts/*.sh` — automation scripts with port references (kill_on_port, lsof, curl checks). These will kill processes or health-check the original instance instead of the new one.
- `.claude/**/*.md` — skills, rules, docs, specs with port references that inform Claude's behavior in the new instance.
- `.claude/**/*.json` and `.claude/**/*.yaml` — hook configs, pipeline definitions that execute in the new instance's context.
- `tenant-config.json` or similar runtime config — dashboards, API endpoints, chat URLs baked into the app at startup.
- OAuth/auth callback URLs and redirect URIs (`CORE_URL`, `callbackUrl`) — auth flows redirect back to the wrong instance, causing login failures.
- CORS origin lists (`CORS_ORIGINS=`) — the new instance's frontend gets blocked by CORS because its port isn't in the allow list.
- Vite/webpack dev server proxy configs with hardcoded targets — dev server proxies API calls to the original instance instead of the local one.
- Docker Compose `ports:` mappings (host:container) — two instances can't bind the same host port.
- Deep link protocol schemes (Electron apps) — both instances register the same OS protocol handler, causing opens to route to the wrong one.
- Chrome DevTools / CDP `remote-debugging-port` in package.json — two Electron instances can't share a CDP port.
- Hardcoded constants in source: `const PORT = 3071` — bypasses .env entirely, immune to patching.
- Frontend `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars with port-bearing URLs — baked in at build time, so runtime .env changes don't help.
- Package.json scripts with port references (`lsof -i :3068`) — port guards and dev scripts target the wrong port.
- CI configs run in isolated containers — skip these.

For each finding, report: **file, line number, current value, and whether it's env-var driven or hardcoded.**

### Agent 3: Build & Dependency Analysis

A copy without installed dependencies and generated code won't start. The install order matters — shared packages must be linked before dependents install, codegen must run before the app can import generated clients. Analyze what it takes to set up a copy:

- Package manager per service/directory (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
- Build commands and order of operations
- Codegen steps: Prisma generate, GraphQL codegen, etc.
- Database setup: migration commands, separate DBs per instance?
- Post-install hooks (native module rebuilds, vendor scripts)
- Shared packages / local linking (yalc, npm link, workspace protocols)
- What to exclude from copy: node_modules, .next, dist, .turbo, .cache, *.tsbuildinfo
- Git submodules that need `--recurse-submodules`
- Private registry tokens (.npmrc referencing env vars)
- Whether repos should be cloned (monorepo with multiple git repos) or rsync-copied (single repo)

---

## Step 8: Register

Based on discovery findings:

### 8a. Determine port specs

For each service, define `name:base:offset`:
- Default offset is `100` (slot 1 → +100, slot 2 → +200)
- Use offset `1` for debug ports like CDP (9222 → 9223, 9224, ...)
- Use offset `100` for everything else unless ports would collide

### 8b. Fix hardcoded ports in source (if any)

Hardcoded ports can't be patched during plant — they need to be fixed in the source so all future instances work. If Agent 2 found hardcoded ports that should be env-var driven, **list them and ask** before modifying source. Common fixes:
- `const PORT = 3071` → `parseInt(process.env.GALLERY_API_PORT ?? '3071', 10)`
- Hardcoded proxy targets → env var interpolation in vite/webpack config
- Docker Compose hardcoded host ports → `${VAR:-default}:container_port`
- Add missing port variables to `.env.example`

### 8c. Check for init script

Look for `.claude/scripts/create-*-env.sh` or similar in the source. If one exists, use it with `--init`. If the project is complex (monorepo, multiple services, database isolation) and has no init script, flag this — the user may want to create one before proceeding.

### 8d. Register

```bash
grove register <source-path> --name <project-name> \
  --port <service1:base1:offset1> \
  --port <service2:base2:offset2> \
  [--init <script-path>] \
  [--teardown <script-path>]
```

---

## Step 9: Plant

```bash
grove plant <project> <instance-name> [--slot N]
```

Parse the `--- grove-output ---` JSON block from stdout. It contains:
- `target` — new instance directory path
- `slot` — assigned slot number
- `ports` — computed port mappings per service
- `source` — source project path

---

## Step 10: Post-Plant Setup

If the project has an init script, it already handled most of this. Check its output to avoid duplicate work. Otherwise, do each of these:

### 10a. Patch .env files
Update all `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.local` files in the target with slot-computed ports. Patch:
- `PORT=` lines
- `*_URL=http://localhost:NNNN` references
- `DATABASE_URL` — use slot-specific DB name if applicable
- `CORS_ORIGINS` with updated port numbers

### 10b. Patch .claude/ directory
Find-and-replace base port numbers with slot ports across all `.md`, `.sh`, `.json`, `.yaml` files in `.claude/`. This is the most commonly missed step — stale ports in the new instance's slash commands and scripts cause Claude sessions to operate on the original instance's services without any visible error.

### 10c. Patch config files
Update `tenant-config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, and similar with slot ports.

### 10d. Install dependencies
Run the appropriate package manager install in each service directory. Watch for:
- Private registry tokens that need exporting
- `--frozen-lockfile` for reproducibility
- Post-install hooks that need specific env vars

### 10e. Run codegen and migrations
- Prisma: `prisma generate` then `prisma migrate deploy`
- Create slot-specific databases if needed
- Any other codegen (GraphQL, OpenAPI, etc.)

---

## Step 11: Verify and Report

### Verification checks

A planted instance that looks complete but has one stale port reference will fail in subtle, hard-to-debug ways — requests silently route to the wrong backend, Claude commands operate on the wrong instance. Verify exhaustively:

- Each service directory exists and has `node_modules/`
- Port references in `.env` files match slot-computed values
- No stale base port references remain in `.claude/` files:
  ```bash
  grep -rl ':<base_port>' <target>/.claude/
  # Should return empty for each base port
  ```
- Branches are correct (if cloned from git)
- Codegen artifacts exist (Prisma client, etc.)

### Report
Output a summary with:
- Instance path, slot number, project name
- Port assignments per service
- What was set up automatically vs. needs manual attention
- Any hardcoded ports still remaining in the source (from Agent 2 findings)
